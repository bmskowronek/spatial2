# spatial2

All graphing files used a modified, reduced version of the data, transformed by the file "datachanger.py". Run this file first, with a correct path set in the script to where your if_data folder is placed, to continue using the other files with plots, graphs etc. This is due to unintelligible performance issues caused by attempting to import dataframes and other content from one python file to another while developing this. Most plotting files generate results in external html files. I considered developing this as a streamlit application which might have been way easier to use, however various performance issues made me tentatively reject it and it remained rejected until this version.
